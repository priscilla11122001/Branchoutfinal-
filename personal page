            <h2> Keeping Up With Physical Health </h2>
            <p> <h6> 1.Physical activity is an important way to prevent heart disease – the nation’s No. 1 killer — and stroke, the nation’s No. 5 killer. </h6>
            <h6> 2.Do at least 2.5 hours of moderate intensity physical activity (think brisk walking), spread across the entire week, to improve your cardiovascular health. </h6>
            <h6> 3.People of all types, shapes, sizes and abilities can benefit from being physically active. </h6>
            <h6> 4. If you haven’t been active for a while, start at a comfortable pace. Gradually increase your exercise intensity and duration as your body adapts to regular activity.<br> Choose activities that are appropriate for you right now.</h6>
            <h6> 5. Added sugar provides empty calories and is believed to be a leading cause of diseases that kill millions of people each year. </h6>
            <h6> 6. The best diet for you is the one that works for you and you can stick to in the long term. </h6>
            <h6> 7. Vegetables are rich in all sorts of nutrients. Eating vegetables each day is associated with improved health and a lower risk of disease. </h6>
            <h6> 8. It is much more important to eat real, nutritious foods than to count on supplements to provide the nutrients you need. </h6>
            <h6> 9. Adopting a healthy lifestyle is the only way to ensure long-term weight loss and a lifetime of improved health. </h6>
            <h6> 10. During food processing, many of the beneficial nutrients in the food are removed, Also potentially harmful ingredients are added like added sugar and trans fats. </h6>

      <p> <h1> Maintaining Your Mental Health </h1> </p>

      <p> <text1> 1. Do your best to enjoy 15 minutes of sunshine, and apply sunscreen. Sunlight synthesizes Vitamin D, which experts believe is a mood elevator. </text1>
      <br>
      <br>
      <text1> 2. Start your day with a cup of co­ffee or green tea. Consumption of both drinks is linked to lower rates of depression. </text1>
      <br>
      <br>
      <text1> 3. Set up a getaway. The act of planning a vacation and having something to look forward to can boost your overall happiness for up to 8 weeks! </text1>
      <br>
      <br>
      <text1> 4. Work your strengths. Do something you're good at to build self-confidence, then tackle a tougher task. </text1>
      <br>
      <br>
      <text1> 5. "You don’t have to see the whole staircase, just take the first step."  -Martin Luther King Jr. </text1>
      <br>
      <br>
      <text1> 6. Show some love to someone in your life. Close, quality relationships are key for a happy, healthy life. </text1>
      <br>
      <br>
      <text1> 7. Take time to laugh. Hang out with a funny friend, watch a comedy or check out cute videos online. Laughter helps reduce anxiety. </text1>
      <br>
      <br>
      <text1> 8. Has something been bothering you? Let it all out…on paper. Writing about upsetting experiences can reduce symptoms of depression. </text1>
      <br>
      <br>
      <text1> 9. Practice forgiveness - even if it's just forgiving that person who cut you off during your commute. People who forgive have better mental health and report being more satisfied with their lives. </text1>
      <br>
      <br>
      <text1> 10. Track gratitude and achievement with a journal.
        <br>
        (Like the one we have below!)
        <br>
        Include 3 things you are grateful for and 3 things you were able to accomplish each day. <text1> </p>
